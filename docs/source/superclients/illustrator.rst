Illustrator
===========

Illustrator is a superclient that enables you to create SVG illustrations using simple textual descriptions. It's uses large language models (LLMs) to transform your ideas into visuals.

Basic Usage
-----------
Here is a simple example of how to use Illustrator:

.. code-block:: python

    from switchai import SwitchAI, Illustrator

    client = SwitchAI(provider="openai", model_name="gpt-4o")

    illustrator = Illustrator(client)
    illustrator.generate_illustration(
        "Design a futuristic logo for my AI app with a sleek, modern aesthetic. "
        "The logo should feature a black background with rounded corners for a "
        "smooth and polished look. Inside, create a minimalist flower design that "
        "embodies innovation and elegance. Use clean lines and subtle gradients or "
        "highlights to give it a sophisticated, high-tech feel, while maintaining "
        "simplicity and balance.",
        output_path="logo.svg",
    )

The above code generates an SVG file named ``logo.svg`` based on the description provided. For example, it might look like this:

.. image:: ../_static/logo.png
    :alt: Example logo
    :align: center

Editor Mode
-----------
Illustrator also supports an editor mode, allowing you to interactively edit illustrations generated by the model. To enable this mode, set the ``editor_mode`` parameter to ``True``. This mode allows you to provide feedback and request changes to the illustration while considering the context of the generated visuals.

Image Reference
---------------
Illustrator supports providing a reference image to guide the model in generating illustrations. This can enhance the relevance of the output, especially when using vision LLMs. To use a reference image, specify the ``image_reference`` parameter:

.. code-block:: python

    from switchai import SwitchAI, Illustrator

    client = SwitchAI(provider="openai", model_name="gpt-4o")

    illustrator = Illustrator(client)
    illustrator.generate_illustration(
        "Design a logo for a tech company with a modern, sleek aesthetic. "
        "The logo should feature two intertwining, minimalistic rectangles, "
        "similar to the reference image provided, with clean lines and a professional feel.",
        output_path="logo.svg",
        editor_mode=True,
        image_reference="path/to/image.jpg",
    )


Here is the reference image and the generated illustration:

.. container:: figures-container

    .. figure:: ../_static/logo_2_reference.jpg
        :alt: Reference image for logo
        :align: left

        Reference Image

    .. figure:: ../_static/logo_2.png
        :alt: Generated logo illustration
        :align: right

        Generated Illustration

While LLMs are not primarily trained for tasks like illustration generation, the results can still be impressive, even with their current vision capabilities.

Illustrator can also generate illustrations based on a photo. For example, you can provide a sunset image, and the model will create an illustration inspired by it:

.. container:: figures-container

    .. figure:: ../_static/sunset_reference.jpg
        :alt: Reference image of a sunset
        :align: left
        :width: 360

        Reference Image

    .. figure:: ../_static/sunset_illustration.png
        :alt: Generated sunset illustration
        :align: right
        :width: 360

        Generated Illustration

Final Notes
-----------
Generating and editing illustrations is an enjoyable and creative process. However, be mindful of the cost of API calls, as they can become expensive. We tested various models, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Since no model is perfect, you may need to experiment with different ones to achieve the best results.
